This repository contains the script for downloading and analysing EDGAR filings and traffic log files used in the paper "Retail Investor Attention and Mutual Fund Performance: Evidence from EDGAR Log Files".

The script is written in a Jupyter notebook and can be run seamlessly in Google Colab. The code is also well-documented, guiding you through each step.

If you use the code, please cite the paper: Ding, Hao, Retail Investor Attention and Mutual Fund Performance: Evidence from EDGAR Log Files.
